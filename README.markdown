## Project Overview

The Pharmaceutical CRM System is a robust platform tailored for pharmaceutical companies to manage marketing activities efficiently. It provides role-based interfaces for **company owners** (to oversee operations and analytics) and **employees** (to handle visits, schedules, and attendance). The system ensures secure, company-centric data isolation, modern design, and cross-platform functionality.

Key objectives:
- Simplify doctor visit scheduling and tracking.
- Streamline attendance and leave management.
- Provide real-time analytics for business insights.
- Deliver a professional, responsive UI across web and mobile.
- Ensure secure authentication and role-based access.

The project is production-ready, featuring a clean, pharmaceutical-inspired aesthetic with blue gradients, Bootstrap 5 styling, and intuitive navigation.

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
     ```plaintext
     SECRET_KEY=your-django-secret-key
     DEBUG=True
     DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3  # Or postgres://user:pass@localhost/dbname
     ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1
     CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
     ```

5. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Create a superuser (optional, for admin access):
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
